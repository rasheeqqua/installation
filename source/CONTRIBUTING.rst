Contributing to Geant4
=====
To contribute patches to Geant4, users can submit Pull Requests (PR) such that:

- A single PR refers to a single particular topic (fix or suggested enhancement);
  PRs including uncorrelated changes in codes in different areas or modules will
  not be considered.

A PR will be examined by a responsible and eventually extracted for a patch in
the development repository of Geant4, to be included in a future release or
patch.

For simple bug-fixes, it is anyhow recommended to use the official
Bugzilla problem reporting system.
